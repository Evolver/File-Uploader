<h1>File Uploader</h1>

File Uploader is a flash-based file uploader, alternative to SWFUpload. It is robust,
fast and easy to use.

<b style="color:red;">File Uploader is under development and it's implementation is experimental. No stable release is currently available</b>

<h2>What makes it great:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Lighweight, uses one SWF embed for all uploader instances on single page</li>
  <li>Supports multiple uploaders (queues) per page without impact on performance</li>
  <li>Supports concurrent uploading</li>
  <li>Supports per-file POST arguments</li>
  <li>Easy-to-use high level API out of box</li>
  <li>Exports low level API to create custom high level APIs</li>
  <li>Supports uploading automatic start</li>
  <li>Designed to support any JavaScript library (currently only jQuery is supported)</li>
  <li>Does just what you expect it to do</li>
  <li>It is Open, alter and use as you wish</li>
</ul>

<h2>Installation and usage</h2>

<h3>Make a File Uploader bundle you need</h3>

File Uploader consists of four elements you need to include in your webpage.

<ol>
  <li>Dependent library (such as jQuery, Prototype.js or something else) and it's binding for FileUploader [located in <b>src/js/dep/</b>]</li>
  <li>File Uploader core file [<b>src/js/fileUploader.core.js</b>]</li>
  <li>File Uploader public API file (API you will use to work with uploader) [located in <b>src/js/api/</b>]</li>
  <li>SWF file [<b>bin/flash/FileUploader.swf</b>]</li>
</ol>

<h3>Deploy File Uploader on your webserver</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Take the files you collected</li>
  <li>Deploy them on your webserver</li>
  <li>Make sure fileUploader.core.js is configured correctly and knows location of your SWF file</li>
  <li>Include <b>dependent library JS</b> code, include <b>dependent library File Uploader bindings</b>, include <b>fileUploader.core.js</b> and <b>File Uploader public API</b> file.</li>
  <li>You are ready to go</li>
</ol>

<h3>Using File Uploader</h3>

<pre>
  // instantiate uploader
  var uploader =new fileUploader.Uploader({
    // url where to upload the file
    'url': 'http://www.example.com/upload.php',
    // file entry name
    'fileName': 'myFile',
    // POST arguments
    'postArgs': {'action':'upload','galleryId':15},
    '
  });
  
  // configure uploader (optional)
  uploader.concurrency =2;
  uploader.timeout =15;
  
  // listen to events
  
  // handle dialog open
  uploader.onDialogOpen =function() {
    
  };
  
  // handle file selection
  uploader.onSelect =function( id, fileInfo) {
    
  };
  
  // handle file removal
  uploader.onRemove =function( id, fileInfo) {
    
  };
  
  // handle dialog closure
  uploader.onDialogClose =function() {
    
  };
  
  // handle file uploading start
  uploader.onUploadStart =function( id, fileInfo) {
    
  };
  
  // handle file uploading progress
  uploader.onUploadProgress =function( id, fileInfo, bytesLoaded, bytesTotal, percComplete) {
    
  };
  
  // handle file uploading error
  uploader.onUploadError =function( id, fileInfo, errorMsg) {
    
  };
  
  // handle file uploading success
  uploader.onUploadSuccess =function( id, fileInfo, serverData, filesPending) {
    
  };
  
  // handle file uploading completion
  uploader.onUploadComplete =function( id, fileInfo, filesPending, removeFromQueue) {
    
  };
  
  // deploy
  uploader.attach( document.getElementById( 'myButton'));
